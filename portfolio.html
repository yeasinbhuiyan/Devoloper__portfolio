            <p class="banner-discription">I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically
                 every day, experimenting   with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python
                  and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through
                   a few hundred RSS feeds. I build  websites that delight and inform. I do it well.
                 I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch
                 in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art
                 so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects
              I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I’d prefer to be using, and
               my Instapaper “Starred” list will give you a glimpse into the reading material I find interesting 
                 enough to share.</p>
